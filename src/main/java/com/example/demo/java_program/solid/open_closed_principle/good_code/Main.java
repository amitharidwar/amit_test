ðŸ§  Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.*/
// This means we can add new functionality without changing existing code

ðŸ§± L â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
       Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
       It means : If a class A is a parent class, and B is a subclass of A, then you should be able to use B wherever A is expected â€” without causing incorrect behavior.
